## Notice

- **Homework Submission Instructions** Please write up your responses to the problems clearly and concisely. We require you to write up your responses with A4 paper. You are allowed and encouraged to work together. You may discuss the homework to understand the problem and reach a solution in groups. However, each student must write down the solution independently. You must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by yourself. (This is for your own benefit: you have to take the examinations alone.)

- **Written Homeworks.** All calculation problems must be written on single-sided A4 paper. The scan version of the paper will also be accepted. Your final submission should be a compressed package with the extension .zip, which includes your codes and explanations (you need to know how to write the manuscript with Markdown or LATEX). Your code should be run step-by-step without any error. Real-time animation is strongly encouraged. 

- **Coding Homeworks.** Most of coding assignments will be done by Python(>=3.5) under a simple [robotics simulator (ir_sim 1.1.8)](https://github.com/hanruihua/ir_sim). Please install this tool with the version 1.1.8 in advance by the following command:

```
pip install ir_sim == 1.1.8
```

- If your IDE is pycharm, there may be some problems about the functionality of Matplotlib, which may lead to the failure of saving the GIF animation. You can follow this [link](https://blog.csdn.net/Weiai_520/article/details/106437605) to solve this problem.
