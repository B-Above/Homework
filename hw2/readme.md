# Homework 2

-- Course: *Intelligent Robot â€“ Professor: Qi Hao*

**Homework Submission Instructions** Please write up your responses to the following problems clearly and concisely. We require you to write up your responses with A4 paper. You are allowed and encouraged to work together. You may discuss the homework to understand the problem and reach a solution in groups. However, each student must write down the solution independently. You must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by yourself. (This is for your own benefit: you have to take the exams alone.)
